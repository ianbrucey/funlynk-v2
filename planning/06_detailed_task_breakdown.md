## Dependencies and Critical Path

### Critical Path Items
1. Backend Foundation (Agent 1) → All other backend work
2. API Contracts → Frontend development
3. Authentication System → All user-facing features
4. Database Schema → All data operations

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Core and Spark backend development can proceed in parallel after foundation
- Mobile foundation can start with basic API contracts
- Web admin can develop alongside Spark backend
- UI development can proceed with mock data initially

### Risk Mitigation
- Regular integration checkpoints
- Shared component library development
- API contract validation
- Cross-team code reviews
- Continuous integration testing
