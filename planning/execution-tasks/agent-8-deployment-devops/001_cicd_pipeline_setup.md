# Task 001: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
**Agent**: Deployment & DevOps Engineer  
**Estimated Time**: 8-9 hours  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: All backend and frontend code complete  

## Overview
Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for Funlynk platform using GitHub Actions, including automated testing, building, security scanning, and deployment to staging and production environments with proper rollback capabilities.

## Prerequisites
- All application code repositories ready
- GitHub repositories configured
- Cloud infrastructure accounts set up (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Docker Hub or container registry access
- Environment secrets and configurations prepared

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Repository Structure and Branch Strategy (1.5 hours)

**Set up Git repository structure:**
```
funlynk-v2/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/           # GitHub Actions workflows
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ISSUE_TEMPLATE/      # Issue templates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/                 # Node.js/Express backend
â”œâ”€â”€ mobile/                  # React Native mobile app
â”œâ”€â”€ admin-dashboard/         # React admin web app
â”œâ”€â”€ docker/                  # Docker configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/          # Infrastructure as Code
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                 # Deployment and utility scripts
â””â”€â”€ docs/                    # Documentation
```

**Configure branch protection rules:**
```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml
protection_rules:
  main:
    required_status_checks:
      strict: true
      contexts:
        - "ci/backend-tests"
        - "ci/frontend-tests"
        - "ci/mobile-tests"
        - "ci/security-scan"
        - "ci/lint-check"
    enforce_admins: true
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 2
      dismiss_stale_reviews: true
      require_code_owner_reviews: true
    restrictions:
      users: []
      teams: ["core-developers"]
```

**Create CODEOWNERS file:**
```
# .github/CODEOWNERS
# Global owners
* @funlynk/core-team

# Backend specific
/backend/ @funlynk/backend-team
/infrastructure/ @funlynk/devops-team

# Frontend specific
/admin-dashboard/ @funlynk/frontend-team
/mobile/ @funlynk/mobile-team

# DevOps and deployment
/.github/workflows/ @funlynk/devops-team
/docker/ @funlynk/devops-team
/scripts/ @funlynk/devops-team
```

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Pull Request Workflow
1. Create a feature branch and make code changes
2. Open a pull request to develop branch
3. Verify all CI checks run and pass
4. Test that merge is blocked if checks fail
5. Verify code review requirements are enforced
6. Test successful merge after approval

### Test Case 2: Deployment Pipeline
1. Merge changes to develop branch
2. Verify staging deployment triggers automatically
3. Test application functionality in staging environment
4. Merge to main branch for production deployment
5. Verify production deployment and smoke tests
6. Test rollback procedure if needed

### Test Case 3: Security and Quality Gates
1. Introduce a security vulnerability in code
2. Verify security scanning catches the issue
3. Test that deployment is blocked
4. Fix the vulnerability and verify pipeline continues
5. Test code quality thresholds and enforcement
