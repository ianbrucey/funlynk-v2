## Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Backend Foundation** (Agent 1) → All other development
2. **Authentication System** → All user-facing features
3. **Database Schema** → All data operations
4. **Mobile Foundation** (Agent 4) → All mobile development
5. **API Contracts** → Frontend development

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Parallel Development**: Core and Spark can develop simultaneously after foundation
- **Mock Data**: Frontend can start with mock data before APIs are ready
- **Incremental Integration**: Regular integration checkpoints to catch issues early
- **Buffer Time**: 2-week buffer built into timeline for unexpected issues
