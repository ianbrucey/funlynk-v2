Okay, understood. Let's outline the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Funlynk, encompassing both the core features and the Funlynk Spark program, with a general activity focus rather than just music. The goal is a highly granular outline suitable for a development team, including the tech stack decision.

sGiven your PHP/Laravel backend experience[cite: 5], we'll leverage that for efficiency. For the frontend, a hybrid mobile approach with React Native is highly recommended to target both iOS and Android from a single codebase, which is crucial for a social app that benefits from broad accessibility. This also allows for potential web app expansion if needed later, as React Native can share components with React.js for web.

* **Database:** MySQL (or PostgreSQL)
* **Mobile App Frontend:** React Native (iOS & Android)
* **Web Interface Frontend:** React.js (for admin and potentially parent portals)
* **Search Engine:** MeiliSearch
* **Payment Processing:** Stripe Connect (integrated, but initial K-12 focus is on program delivery, not immediate per-student revenue)
* **Cloud Hosting:** AWS (S3 for storage, EC2 for instances)

**I. User Roles & Access Control:**

1.  **Funlynk Admin / Program Manager (Web Interface):**
    * Full access to program creation, scheduling, and overall Spark program oversight.
    * Access to aggregated reporting across all schools/districts.
2.  **School District Admin / Coordinator (Web Interface):**
    * Manage school profiles within their district.
    * Approve/oversee field trip bookings for their schools.
    * Access to district-level reports.
3.  **Teacher / Chaperone (Web Interface & Mobile App):**
    * Web: Browse/book field trips, manage classes, view permission slip status, manage rosters.
    * Mobile: On-site attendance tracking, access to emergency contacts, in-app communication for active trips.
4.  **Parent / Guardian (Mobile App & Web View for Slips):**
    * Receive notifications, access child's trip details, digitally sign permission slips.
