## üîó Integration Strategy

### How Our Work Connects
- **Technical Lead's controllers** ‚Üí **Auggie-2's services** (dependency injection)
- **Technical Lead's models** ‚Üí **Auggie-2's business logic** (data manipulation)
- **Technical Lead's routes** ‚Üí **Auggie-2's validation** (request processing)
- **Technical Lead's resources** ‚Üí **Auggie-2's service responses** (data transformation)

### Critical Integration Points
1. **Service Method Signatures**: Controllers expect specific social service methods
2. **Model Relationships**: Services use model relationships for social graph analysis
3. **Validation Rules**: Requests must match controller parameter expectations
4. **Real-time Integration**: WebSocket events triggered by service methods
5. **Notification Strategy**: Consistent notification approach across all social features
