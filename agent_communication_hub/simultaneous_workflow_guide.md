# Simultaneous Development Workflow Guide

## üéØ New Approach: No Monitoring Loops

Instead of complex monitoring systems, both agents work simultaneously on complementary tasks with clear boundaries.

## üîÑ Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Human Input
- Human writes request in `agent_communication_hub/human_input.md`
- Request should be substantial enough to split into parallel work

### Step 2: Technical Lead Processing
- Technical Lead reads human input
- Responds with acknowledgment and task breakdown plan
- Creates **two simultaneous tasks** using the template format
- Posts both tasks in `agent_communication_hub/instructions.md`

### Step 3: Simultaneous Execution
- **Technical Lead** starts working on their assigned task immediately
- **Warp Agent** receives their task assignment and starts working
- **Both work in parallel** on different files/directories
- **No monitoring needed** - direct task assignment

### Step 4: Integration & Completion
- Both agents complete their tasks
- Technical Lead coordinates integration if needed
- Both report completion and deliverables
- Technical Lead reports back to human

## üõ°Ô∏è Conflict Avoidance Strategy

### File/Directory Separation

**Technical Lead Typically Handles:**
- Main controllers (`app/Http/Controllers/`)
- Route definitions (`routes/`)
- Middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/`)
- Configuration files (`config/`)
- Main application architecture

**Warp Agent Typically Handles:**
- Service layer (`app/Services/`)
- Form requests (`app/Http/Requests/`)
- Tests (`tests/Unit/`, `tests/Feature/`)
- Utilities (`app/Utils/`)
- Database factories/seeders

### Clear Task Boundaries
Each task specifies:
- **Exact files** to create/modify
- **Directories** to work in
- **Responsibilities** that don't overlap
- **Integration points** with the other agent's work

## üìã Task Assignment Template

```markdown
## Technical Lead Task
**Files/Directories**: [Specific files only]
**Responsibilities**: [Clear, non-overlapping duties]

## Warp Agent Task  
**Files/Directories**: [Different specific files]
**Responsibilities**: [Complementary duties]

## Integration Notes
**How work combines**: [Clear integration plan]
```

## üß™ Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Authentication System
- **Technical Lead**: AuthController, middleware, routes, config
- **Warp Agent**: AuthService, form requests, tests, password reset
- **Integration**: Controller injects and uses AuthService

### Scenario 2: User Management
- **Technical Lead**: UserController, routes, middleware
- **Warp Agent**: UserService, validation, tests, utilities
- **Integration**: Controller uses service methods

### Scenario 3: API Endpoint
- **Technical Lead**: Controller structure, routes, middleware
- **Warp Agent**: Business logic service, tests, validation
- **Integration**: Controller delegates to service

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

1. **No File Conflicts**: Agents work on completely different files
2. **Clean Integration**: Work combines seamlessly
3. **Standards Compliance**: Both follow coding standards
4. **Complete Deliverables**: All requirements met
5. **Working Tests**: Tests pass for integrated system

## üöÄ Benefits of This Approach

- **No Complex Monitoring**: Direct task assignment
- **True Parallelism**: Both agents work simultaneously
- **Conflict-Free**: Clear file boundaries prevent issues
- **Efficient**: No waiting or polling loops
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more agents with clear boundaries
- **Human-Trackable**: Simple to understand and monitor
