## üéØ Current Human Direction

### Project Phase: Complete Program Management API
**Date**: 2025-01-16
**Priority**: High

### Instructions for Technical Lead:

We need to complete the remaining 40% of Agent 3, Task 002: Program Management API. According to our progress documentation, this task is 60% complete with the core models, controllers, and infrastructure done. I want both you and the Warp agent to work simultaneously to finish this critical component.

**Current Status (60% Complete)**:
- ‚úÖ Core Models: SparkProgram, CharacterTopic, ProgramAvailability
- ‚úÖ API Controllers: ProgramController (15 endpoints), CharacterTopicController (9 endpoints)
- ‚úÖ Request Validation: CreateProgramRequest implemented
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: Factories, seeders, utilities, availability management

**Remaining Work (40% to Complete)**:
1. Request Validation: UpdateProgramRequest and character topic request classes
2. Service Layer: ProgramService and CharacterTopicService with business logic
3. Resource Layer: Update ProgramResource and create CharacterTopicResource
4. API Routes: Add program and character topic routes to spark.php
5. Service Registration: Register new services in SparkServiceProvider
6. Testing: Create and run tests for program management functionality

**Specific Direction:**
- Break this remaining work into two complementary tasks for simultaneous execution
- Ensure no file conflicts by assigning different files/directories to each agent
- Reference the detailed specification in `/planning/execution-tasks/agent-3-spark-backend/002_program_management_api.md`
- Follow all PSR-12 coding standards and existing project patterns
- Integrate with existing Spark infrastructure (schools, districts, etc.)

**Success Criteria:**
- Program Management API 100% complete and functional
- All CRUD operations working for programs and character topics
- Resource file upload functionality working
- Program availability management complete
- All tests passing with good coverage
- API routes properly registered and working
- Services properly registered in SparkServiceProvider
- Code integrates seamlessly with existing Spark backend

**Questions for Technical Lead:**
- How will you divide the remaining work to avoid conflicts?
- What's your integration and testing strategy?
- Any dependencies or blockers I should know about?

## üìù Communication Log

### Technical Lead Response - 2025-01-16 14:30:00
**Status**: ‚úÖ Acknowledged and Processing

**Analysis**:
Your system test request is well-structured and perfect for validating our multi-agent communication flow. I understand you want to test the complete workflow from task assignment through completion.

**Task Breakdown**:
I will create a structured task assignment for the Warp agent to:
1. Create a simple PHP "Hello World" test file in `tests/system/`
2. Ensure PSR-12 compliance per our coding standards
3. Demonstrate proper communication protocol usage

**Timeline**:
- Task assignment: Immediate
- Expected completion: 15-30 minutes
- Full workflow validation: Complete within 1 hour

**Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Creating structured task in `instructions.md`
2. üîÑ Monitoring Warp agent pickup and execution
3. üìä Tracking progress through status files
4. üìù Reporting back with results

**Communication System Status**:
- All files are properly structured ‚úÖ
- Agent status tracking is active ‚úÖ
- Task assignment format is ready ‚úÖ
- Communication delimiters are configured ‚úÖ

I'm now proceeding to create the task assignment. You should see activity in the `instructions.md` file and subsequent agent status updates.

## üîÑ How This Works

1. **You write your instructions above** in plain English
2. **Technical Lead (VS Code agent) reads this file** and creates structured tasks
3. **Technical Lead updates `instructions.md`** with specific task assignments
4. **Other agents monitor and execute** the assigned tasks
5. **Technical Lead reports back here** with progress and questions
