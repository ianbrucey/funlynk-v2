- **Strict Adherence**: Follow execution-tasks specifications exactly as written
- **Regular Communication**: Update progress documentation every 2 hours
- **Early Testing**: Create and run tests immediately after implementation
- **Code Review**: Augment reviews all implementations against specifications
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep commits small and focused for easy rollback if needed

### **Escalation Process**:
1. **Minor Issues**: Document in progress file and continue with workaround
2. **Blocking Issues**: Stop work, document issue, and request coordination
3. **Specification Questions**: Reference original execution-tasks files for clarification
